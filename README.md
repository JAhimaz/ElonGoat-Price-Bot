A bot created for Telegram to track the current market statistics of ElonGoat Token
Done as a fun little project as I noticed people had paid for this, and wanted it to be free for all developers to change and make their own.

You can join the telegram group where this bot is present and have a go at it yourself:
https://t.me/testbotgroupelongoat

Commands are:

`/price /mcap /marketcap /stats` - Sends the market statistics of the token.

`/chart` - Sends the possible Charts.

`/contract` - Sends the contract of the token.
